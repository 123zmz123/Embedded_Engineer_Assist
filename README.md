## why I build this?

As an Embedded Engineer When i write dirvers , i find is boring and hard to configure registers in microprocesser.

So I write s softerware to help me set registers .

It list 

### Bit7 ...... Bit0
 
 you can set each of it as 1 or 0 

 and then it can show you the register value at real time.

## Register Configure

you can config your Registers in csv format file named RegConfig.csv.

Pls put RegConfig.csv and Embedded_Assist.exe in the same file.

our format as below:

Register Discribe, Bit7 description,Bit6 description,Bit5 description,Bit4 description,Bit3 description,Bit2 description,Bit1 description,
Bit0 description

pls dont forget "," between each descriptions.
