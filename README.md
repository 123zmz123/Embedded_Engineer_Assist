## why I build this?

As an Embedded Engineer When i write dirvers , i find is boring and hard to configure registers in microprocesser.

So I write s softerware to help me set registers .

It list 

### Bit7 ...... Bit0
 
 you can set each of it as 1 or 0 

 and then it can show you the register value at real time.

 I will add  function for configure registers through .csv format file.

I will add others to reduce our workload.
